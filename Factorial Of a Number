Procedure Factorial
// Initialize factorial to 1, as 0! = 1
  factorial := 1

  // Loop from 1 to the number
  for i := 1 to number 
    // Multiply factorial by the current loop counter (i)
    factorial := factorial * i

  // Return the calculated factorial
  return factorial

// Example usage
number := 5  // Replace with the desired number
result := factorial(number)

// Print the result (optional)
print("The factorial of", number, "is", result)
End Procedure
